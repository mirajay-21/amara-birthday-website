      Love,Birthdays.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Birthdays,<br/>
      The days I once waited for with wild anticipation,<br/>
      The days I laid out special clothes the night before,<br/>
      The days I wished would come twice a year-<br/>
      Ah, the beauty of childish glee and innocent wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birthdays,<br/>
      The days I quietly dread now,<br/>
      The days that whisper of time slipping by,<br/>
      The days I wish would slow their pace- <br/>
      Just enough to let me feel like I'm not being left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birthdays, <br/>
      The 21st of May- <br/>
      A date forever etched in my heart, <br/>
      A date I'll always look forward to, <br/>
      A date wrapped in beauty, warmth and meaning, <br/>
      A date I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what has happened, <br/>
      Is happening, <br/>
      Or will happen- <br/>
      Birthdays- my birthdays- <br/>
      I'll always cherish.
    </p>
