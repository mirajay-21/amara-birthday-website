     I know some people might think that asking for specific gifts for your birthday is weird, <br/> but I'd hate for you to spend money on something for me and I end up hating it. <br/> So, this is more for <span> you</span> than me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it as me doing you a favour - saving you from the stress of standing in a store, <br/> holding two things in your hand and asking, <span> "Will she like this?" </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please bear in mind that these gifts aren't demands, <br/>they're just gentle suggestions from your favorite birthday girl <span>(ahem, me)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you pick something from this list or just send me your love and prayers, <br/> trust me - your thoughtfulness already means the world to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you insist on wrapping something shiny for me, well....
