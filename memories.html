      So anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for memories in the form of pictures and videos. Cheesy? Yeah, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But will that make me change? ABSOLUTELY NOT! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because after all that's said and done, we need to be reminded exactly how we felt at a particular time. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy, sadness, laughter, feelings, people, jokes, banter, music and fights are more vivid when we can see them again in that  particular  moment - like a trip back in time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because, trust me, we'll need to - or feel like - experiencing them again. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe because we miss who we were at that particular moment or just to look back and see how far we've come.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, take that picture. Record that video. Who knows when you'd need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, here's mine.
    </p>
    <br/>
      PS: This video might not be up to date. I don't have the strength to edit it from last year's own. But, I <em>might</em> do a new video to summarize how the past year has been. 
    <br/>
      But if I don't, forgive me.
