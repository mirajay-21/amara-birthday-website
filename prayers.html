        My Birthday Prayers.
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          May I find my direction this new year. May I find clarity and purpose in every area of my life.
        </li>
        <li>
          May my family have long life, peace of mind and the strength to enjoy all the goodness that life has to offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          May my love be covered in understanding, patience, laughter and may love never feel like a chore.
        </li>
        <li>
          May my friends always feel seen, supported and loved. May we show up for one another in ways that truly matter. 
        </li>
        <li>
          May my finances flourish. May I never lack what I need and may I always have more than enough to bless others too.
        </li>
        <li>
          May the right doors open before me - the kind of opportunities that align with who I am and where I want to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          May my mind and body remain clear. May I never take the little things for granted.
        </li>
        <li>
          May this birthday bring all the answers to my unanswered prayers and may I also grow in my spiritual life with Christ.
